(1) How can we use artificial neural networks to do image segmentation?
	By answering this question we should be able to design an image segmentation
	model.
	
(2) What are the state of the art methods and what are their respective
	advantages and disadvantages? 
	By answering this question we should learn how to select and combine the 
	available building blocks in the construction of the overall algorithm. 
	
(3) How can the methods be evaluated?
	By answering this we should learn choose and calculate objective statistics
	describing the performance of the model.
	
(4) How can TensorFlow be used in the implemantion of the above mentioned problems?
	We should learn how to implement a deep learning model using TensorFlow.
